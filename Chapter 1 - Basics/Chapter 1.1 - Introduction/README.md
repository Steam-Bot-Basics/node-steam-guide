# Chapter 1.1 - Introduction 

### What kind of tasks can bots perform? 
Steam bots can be used for many things:
 - Donation Bots
 - Chat bots
 - Trade bots (in Steam or connected to a website)
 - Giveaways
 
### What is the purpose of bots and APIs? (w/ examples) 
Websites like [scrap.tf](https://scrap.tf), [cs.money](https://cs.money), and [marketplace.tf](https://marketplace.tf) each use their own unique bots that perform functions through Steam (using its API).  Websites like these also use services that handle updating prices of Steam items.  They often use Steam's Community Market API to handle pricing, or find custom built APIs made by other Steam users.  Examples of pricing APIs include [CsGoFast](https://api.csgofast.com/price/all) which is free to use, [BitSkins](https://bitskins.com/api) which offers free basic services, and [OPSkins](https://docs.opskins.com/public/en.html) which offers free services but they limit daily queries to 30,000.

### What will I learn in this course?

bots to fully-functioning trade websites.
